"""ankavm backend blueprints package (v2.8 modularization).

The historic `app.py` ships ~270 routes in a single 30k-line file. v2.8
introduces a `blueprints/` package that hosts domain-scoped Flask
blueprints — auth, vms, networks, storage, monitoring — each exposing
new `/api/v2/{domain}/*` endpoints.

Legacy `/api/*` routes in `app.py` are kept for backward compatibility.
New work lands in blueprints; old routes will be retired in a future
release once all clients migrate.
